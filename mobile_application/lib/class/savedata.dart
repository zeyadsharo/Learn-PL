      \n To know why the for-each loop is preferred over for loop while working with arrays, let's see the following example.

      \n 
      \n class ForLoop {
      \n     public static void main(String[] args) {
      \n

      \n         for (int i = 0; i < vowels.length; ++ i) {
      \n             System.out.println(vowels[i]);
      \n         }
      \n     }
      \n }
      \n Output:
      \n 
      \n a
      \n e
      \n i
      \n o
      \n u
      \n Now we will perform the same task using the for-each loop.
      \n 
      \n class AssignmentOperator {
      \n    public static void main(String[] args) {
      \n

      \n       // foreach loop
      \n       for (char item: vowels) {
      \n          System.out.println(item);
      \n       }
      \n    }
      \n }
      \n Output:
      \n 
      \n a
      \n e
      \n i
      \n o
      \n u
      \n Here, we can see that the output of both the program is the same.
      \n 
      \n When we carefully analyze both the program, we can notice that the for-each loop is easier to write and makes our code more readable. This is the reason it is called enhanced for loop.
      \n 
      \n Hence, it is recommended to use the enhanced for loop over the standard for loop whenever possible.
      \n 
      \n Java for-each loop
      \n Let's first look at the syntax of for each loop:
      \n 
      \n for(data_type item : collections) {
      \n     ...
      \n }
      \n Here,

      \n collection - a collection or array that you have to loop through.
      \n item - a single item from the collections.

      """
    \nJava Classes/Objects
    \nJava is an object-oriented programming language.
    \n
    \nEverything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. 
    \nFor example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color,
    \n and methods, such as drive and brake.
    \nA Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
    \nCreate a Class
    \nTo create a class, use the keyword class:
    \nMyClass.java
    \nCreate a class named "MyClass" with a variable x:
    \npublic class MyClass {
    \n  int x = 5;
    \n}
    \n Create an Object
    \n In Java, an object is created from a class. We have already created the class named MyClass, so now we can use this to create objects.
    \n 
    \n To create an object of MyClass, specify the class name, followed by the object name, and use the keyword new:
    \n 
    \n Example
    \n Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:
    \n 
    \n public class MyClass {
    \n   int x = 5;
    \n 
    \n   public static void main(String[] args) {
    \n     MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
    \n     System.out.println(myObj.x);
    \n   }
    \n }
""",
      """
      \n Java Class Methods
      \n You learned from the Java Methods chapter that methods are declared within a class, and that they are used to perform certain actions:
      \n 
      \n Example
      \n Create a method named myMethod() in MyClass:
      \n 
      \n public class MyClass {
      \n   static void myMethod() {
      \n     System.out.println("Hello World!");
      \n   }
      \n }
      \n 
      \n myMethod() prints a text (the action), when it is called. To call a method, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
      \n 
      \n Example
      \n Inside main, call myMethod():
      \n 
      \n public class MyClass {
      \n   static void myMethod() {
      \n     System.out.println("Hello World!");
      \n   }
      \n 
      \n   public static void main(String[] args) {
      \n     myMethod();
      \n   }
      \n }
      \n 
      \n // Outputs "Hello World!"
      \n 
      \n 
      \n """,
      """
      Java Class Attributes
      \n Java Class Attributes
      \n In the previous chapter, we used the term "variable" for x in the example (as shown below). It is actually an attribute of the class. Or you could say that class attributes are variables within a class:
      \n Example
      \n Create a class called "MyClass" with two attributes: x and y:
      \n public class MyClass {
      \n   int x = 5;
      \n   int y = 3;
      \n }
      \n Another term for class attributes is fields.
      \n Accessing Attributes
      \n You can access attributes by creating an object of the class, and by using the dot syntax (.):
      \n The following example will create an object of the MyClass class, with the name myObj. We use the x attribute on the object to print its value:
      \n Example
      \n Create an object called "myObj" and print the value of x:
      \n public class MyClass {
      \n   int x = 5;
      \n   public static void main(String[] args) {
      \n     MyClass myObj = new MyClass();
      \n     System.out.println(myObj.x);
      \n   }
      \n }
      """,
      """
       Modifiers
      \n By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in almost all of our examples:
      \n 
      \n public class MyClass
      \n The public keyword is an access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.
      \n 
      \n We divide modifiers into two groups:
      \n 
      \n Access Modifiers - controls the access level
      \n Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality
      \nFor attributes, methods and constructors, you can use the one of the following:
      \n
      \nModifier	Description	Try it
      \npublic	The code is accessible for all classes	
      \nprivate	The code is only accessible within the declared class	
      \ndefault	The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier. You will learn more about packages in the Packages chapter	
      \nprotected	The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses. You will learn more about subclasses and superclasses in the Inheritance chapter
      """,
      """
      Encapsulation
      \n The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:
      \n 
      \n declare class variables/attributes as private
      \n provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable
      \n Get and Set
      \n You learned from the previous chapter that private variables can only be accessed within the same class (an outside class has no access to it). However, it is possible to access them if we provide public get and set methods.
      \n 
      \n The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
      \n 
      \n Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:
      \n 
      \n Example
      \n public class Person {
      \n   private String name; // private = restricted access
      \n 
      \n   // Getter
      \n   public String getName() {
      \n     return name;
      \n   }
      \n 
      \n   // Setter
      \n   public void setName(String newName) {
      \n     this.name = newName;

      \n }""",
      """Java Constructors
  \nA constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:

\nCreate a constructor:

\n// Create a MyClass class
\npublic class MyClass {
\n  int x;  // Create a class attribute
\n
\n  // Create a class constructor for the MyClass class
\n  public MyClass() {

\n  public static void main(String[] args) {
\n    MyClass myObj = new MyClass(); // Create an object of class MyClass (This will call the constructor)
\n    System.out.println(myObj.x); // Print the value of x
